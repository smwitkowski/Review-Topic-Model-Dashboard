## Overview

In this project, I build a topic model using review data from TripAdvisor to highlight the benefit of building an interactive dashboard, enabling others to "see the forest from the trees". 

In this README you'll find technical details about the project, including steps on how to reproduce the results. For a detailed walkthough of the project, please visit my blog or Medium article [LINK TBD].

The final output can be found on my personal website at [shiny-app.stephen-witkowski.com](http://shiny-app.stephen-witkowski.com/).



I found the data after combing through some NLP datasets on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/inigolopezrioboo/a-tripadvisor-dataset-for-nlp-tasks).
